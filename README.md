In order to use the extension, you must first pull the contents onto local system. 

Once the project is on the local system, the next step is loading the project folder. This can be done by going to chrome://extensions/, and then from there, select load unpacked, and select the project folder from local system. 

Once the project is loaded, the extension can simply be used by clicking on the extension tab on the top right and accessing the extension as any normal extension.
